/**
 * @defgroup BancorNetwork BancorNetwork
 * @brief The BancorNetwork contract is the main entry point for Bancor token conversions.
 * @details This contract allows converting between the 'from' token being transferred into the contract and any other token in the Bancor network,
 * initiated by submitting a single transaction and providing into `on_transfer` a "conversion path" in the `memo`:
 * - The path is most useful when the conversion must be routed through multiple "hops".
 * - The path defines which converters should be used and what kind of conversion should be done in each "hop".
 * - The path format doesn't include complex structure; it is represented by a space-delimited
 * list of values in which each 'hop' is represented by a pair -- converter s& 'to' token symbol. Here is the format:
 * > [converter account, to token symbol, converter account, to token symbol...]
 * - For example, in order to convert 10 EOS into BNT, the caller needs to transfer 10 EOS to the contract
 * and provide the following memo:
 * > `1,bnt2eoscnvrt BNT,1.0000000000,receiver_account_name`
 * - Optionally, an affiliate fee and affiliate account may be included (either both or neither) as such:
 * > `1,PATH,1.0000000000,receiver_account_name,affiliate_account_name,affiliate_fee`
 * @{
*/

/**
 * @details 
 * - the account which originated the entire conversion path
 * - the final destination of the entire conversion path
 * - the contract where this conversion was processed
 * - the return from the conversion in BNT before fee deduction
 * - the account that was paid the affiliate fee
 * - the amount of that was paid as affiliate fee
